    You are an advanced data extraction system specialized in parsing invoice documents. Your task is to extract specific details from the provided text and output them in a structured JSON format. The details to extract include:
    
    - invoice_number: The unique number identifying the invoice.
    - invoice_date: The date the invoice was issued.
    - invoice_due_date: The date or number of days by which the payment should be made. If the due_date is given in number of days, add those many days to the invoice_date and get the new calendar due_date. For example if the invoice date is 03/10/2024 and the due days/date is 15 days the new calendar due date will be 03/15/2024.
    - invoice_to: The entity/company to which the invoice is addressed or in other words the entity which will pay.
    - contact_number: The contact number of the company to which the invoice is raised.
    - email: The email of the company to which the invoice is raised.
    - invoice_subtotal_due: Sub total due of all the line items before tax.
    - invoice_tax_due: Total tax amount due specifiend in the invoice text which is levied on Sub total.
    - invoice_total_due: Total amount due including tax and subtotal.
    - line_items: Invoice items containing item description, hrs or quantity, rate or cost and line total.

    Context/Text:
    {text}

    ***Important:***
    - If the due_date is given in number of days, add those many days to the invoice_date and get the new calendar due_date. For example if the invoice date is 03/10/2024 and the due days/date is 15 days the new calendar due date will be 03/15/2024.
    - Only use information directly from the text given in context above. Do not infer or hallucinate values.
    - Double check for the invoice line items and ensure that you are not missing any of it.

    ***Instructions:***
    - Carefully read through the provided text to locate the required details.
    - Ensure that the JSON output adheres to the specified format.
    - If a field is not found, return 'NA' for that field.

    ***Tax:***
    - Tax amount can't be less than $0.00. It has to have have some value equal to or greater than zero while less than sub total.

    Example output when all fields are available:

def verify_invoice_details(details):

    As an advanced verification system, you are tasked with verifying the correctness of the invoice details by performing mathematical checks:

    - Calculate if the sub_total plus tax equals the total.
    - Calculate if the total minus amount_paid equals the total_due.

    Given Invoice Details:
    sub_total: {details['sub_total']}
    tax: {details['tax']}
    total: {details['total']}
    amount_paid: {details['amount_paid']}
    total_due: {details['total_due']}

    if (sub_total + tax) == total and (total - amount_paid) == total_due: 
        verification_result = True
    else:
        verification_result = False

    Instructions:
    - Perform the required verifications.
    - Return the results of the verifications in a structured JSON format.
    - If any amount/price/money field have missing values, assume '$0.00' for that field.
    - Include the details of the calculations that you will do on the above given invoice details in the response.
    - Always give amount fields with the precision of 2 decimal places e.g. 102.20

    Response fromat:
    {{
        "verification": verification

    Example output when 'verification_result' is equal to 'True':

    Example output when 'verification_result' is equal to 'False':
    {{

    - bill_date: The date the bill was issued.
    - bill_payment_date: The date on which the payment was done.
    - bill_paid_by: The amount paid by which person or company.

        Case 1: Discrepancies Found
        1. If discrepancy found in subtotal: "There is a discrepancy of {{give the value of subtotal_difference here}} in the subtotal. The invoice shows a subtotal of ${invoice_subtotal_due:.2f}, while the bill indicates a subtotal of ${subtotal_bills:.2f}."
        2. If discrepancy found in the tax: "There is a discrepancy of {{give the value of tax_difference here}} in the tax. The invoice indicates tax due of ${invoice_tax_due:.2f}, whereas the bill shows tax paid as ${tax_bills:.2f}."

        "All amounts match. No discrepancies found between the invoice and bill."

    ***Instructions***
    - Compare the similar details between the invoice and the bill.
    - Highlight any discrepancies.
    - Do not miss any of the fields, especially the fields like subtotal_difference, tax_difference, and total_difference in the response JSON.
    - Confirm if the details match or if there are any inconsistencies.
    - Provide a structured JSON output summarizing the reconciliation.
    - Always give amount fields with the precision of 2 decimal places e.g. 102.20
